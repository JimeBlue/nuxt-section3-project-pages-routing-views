  <!-- EXPLANATION: I want to add a header with a navbar
  to my project. So, I will add the header here, in the
  default.vue file so that navbar can be seen in all the 
  pages of my project. -->
  <!-- 1) Go to the components folder a create inside
  a folder called Navigation. Inside create three files: 
  TheHeader, TheSidenav and TheSideNavToggle. An explanation
  of what there is inside these files in included in the
  files themselves.-->
  <div>
        <!-- 4) Use TheHeader and TheSidenav components.  -->
        <!-- 5) In TheHeader, listen to the custom event @sidenavToggle, 
        which is emited from TheHeader, to determine whether the TheSidenav
        should be shown or not. -->
        <TheHeader @sidenavToggle = "displaySidenav = !displaySidenav"/>
        <!-- 7) Pass the show property to the TheSidenav and bind it 
        to the dynamic displaySidenav value.-->
        <!-- 8)  In TheSidenav listen to the event close, which
        is emited from TheSidenav and set displaySidenav to false
        to close the TheSidenav. -->
        <!-- 9) Now if I go to my local host, I can see the header,
        and if I shrink the page I can see the toogler button for
        the mobile version.  -->
